# Checker Fuse

Checker Fuse is a project aimed at tracking the progression of a set of students listed within an application. It provides real-time check-in and check-out functionalities, contributing to productivity management within educational or work environments.

## Features

- **Single Button Interface**: Users interact with the application through a single button interface, simplifying the process of managing student statuses.

- **Three Options**: The application offers three distinct options:
  1. **Engaged**: Indicates that the student is actively participating or involved.
  2. **Dormant**: Suggests that the student is inactive or temporarily unavailable.
  3. **Serenity**: Indicates a state of calmness or tranquility.

- **Visual State Representation**: Alongside the name of each student, their current state (Engaged, Dormant, or Serenity) is clearly displayed, providing immediate insight into their status.
